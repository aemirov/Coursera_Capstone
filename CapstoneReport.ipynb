Since the beginning of the pandemic, it was obvious that Montreal would probably be the hottest spot of the province but, as weeks went by, it also became apparent that some areas of the island were more affected than others.\n",

Next, we removed the noise from the table body; this included removing the comma in values above 1000, removing ***\"<\"*** for some very small values, and ***\"*\"*** for values with a citation at the footer of the table. Furthermore, the value ***\"n.p.\"*** was replaced by 0. The finalize the cleanup process, ***NAN*** values were converted to 0, as well.

We can infer the pupolation of the borough by dividing the confirmed cases by the confrmed rate per 100K people. This gave us a very close approximation of the real population numbers as reported by the last Canadian census of 2016. Unfortunately, the Senneville borough did not have a value for the confirmed rate so the population could not be calculated, the actual value from the was manually entered for that particular case.\n",

As expected, confirmed infections and mortality are quite closely related, which makes sense as no efficient treatment is available as of yet. This leads one to believe that the role of clinics is mainly to perform testing and relieve those patients who exhibit the worst symptoms, usually requiring intensive care."

    "Although this reporty has provided a good insight into the current situation, a more thorough analysis of demographics would be required to better understand the factor that lead some boroughs to have so many more cases. Unfortunately, the data was not readily available. The closest dataset that provide this information is the Canada census 2016 but it is based on FSAs (Forward Sortation Areas) as opposed to borough names, and would require a lot of approximation to adapt it. Another option is the Ville de Montreal website that provides publications about demographiques by borough, but they are in PDF format and with no speficic structure, so they would require a lot of manual interaction to extract, which is outside of the scope of this analysis."
